Required Tools : Visual Studio code
Required Packages : nodejs, angular/cli, node/modules, express(NodeJS)


Angular Code :
Refer the code which is in article-client folder for Angular.
As we have little bit of knowledge on Angular we need to concentrate on NodeJS.

NodeJS Code :
Refer the code which is in article-server folder for NodeJS.
Below are steps for NodeJS

1. Create folder called -> article-server
2. Create file called -> server.js (inside article-server folder)
3. Install express -> npm install expess
4. Write below code inside server.js
	const express = require("express");
	const app = express();
	app.listen(8000, () => {
		console.log("Server is started and listening");
	});

5. Running NodeJS:
	In command -> node server.js

6. Copy gitignore file from article-client and paste into article-server folder
	// Now we are going call API
	app.get("/", function(request,response) {
		response.send("Hello Node JS");
	});

7. You will definitely will get CORS Policy error (because cilent URL is localhost:4200 and
 	server url is localhost: 8000 both are different)
Solution : Install CORS -> npm i cors
		Write belowcode in server.js file

		const cors = require("cors");

		var corsOptions = {
		origin: ['http://localhost:4200', 'http://localhost:8000]
		}
		app.use(cors(corsOption));
